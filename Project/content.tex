\section{Introduction}
People with disabilities represented a large neglected tourism market. According to
Amadeus annual report, 15 percent of worldwide population (around 1 billion people) lives
with some form of disability \cite{Ama}. According to United Nation, people with 
disabilities are the largest minority group in the world
\cite{Appleyard2005,DARCY2010816,Lex}. Notably, the number of people with disabilities is
expected to increase as a  result of extension of human life-span, decreases in
communicable diseases, the improvement of medical technology, and decrease of child
mortality \cite{SMITH1987376}.  While some forms of disabilities might be genetic, but
temporary or permanent disabilities can happen to anyone, such 
as spinal cord injury after car accident, or limited mobility at later stage of life
\cite{Lex}. 

Population aging trend also signifies that disability will be a more common
and urgent issue in the future \cite{Grue}. The World Health Organization estimates that
by 2050, 21.5 per cent of the global population will be aged over 65. People with
accessibility issues represent a large and fast growing minority group
worldwide, and travel and tourism demand of this group is often ignored. According to the
Open Door Organization (ODO) market report in 2015, people with disabilities spend 17.3
billion dollars annually for their own travel. Because people with disabilities usually
needs a care giver or family member to accompany them when traveling, the potential
economic impact could double \cite{ODO}. 


Accessible travel or accessible tourism refers to the inclusive travel activities that
enable people with access requirements, including mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive
dimensions of access, to function independently, with equity and dignity through the
delivery of universally designed tourism products, services and environments \cite{Ama}.
However, the travel experiences for people with disabilities are more than access
issues. In order to achieve travel accessibility, which means provide travel activities
for people with disabilities, a variety of aspects for travel needs to be taken in
consideration. An accessible destination and appropriate accommodation only lay the 
foundation for a particular travel experience to happen for people with 
disabilities \cite{ODO}. More aspects that need to
consider for people who are traveling with disabilities, such as accessible
transportation, accessible online booking\cite{Ama}.

The ultimate aim for those involved in supporting accessible travel is to empower every
individual to plan and travel independently, at their own will \cite{zhang2016}. However,
the task is not a easy one. Making the whole travel chain accessible, including the
information and booking procedures, as well as the infrastructure and processes become a
important task for travel accessibility \cite{Ama}. 

The development of information communication technologies especially the creation
and distribution of user-generated content (UGC) or consumer-generated content (CGC) has
successfully changed how people travel and how people gather information for travel
\cite{chung2009}. Big data application and analytics has become a trending topic for both
the tourism industry and tourism studies \cite{chung2009}. With the development of 
information and digital technology has changed many people's
lives, especially the life of people with disabilities has also been improved by
technology \cite{GJT14}. People with poor visions can using cell phones to contact
others, access information online with screen readers. People with hearing problems can
text other people with their cell phone. The use of big data for
disability informatics and developing assistive technology has been studies to improve
the quality of life for people with disabilities \cite{Grue}. 

Although big data is becoming an important topic in both tourism studies and disability
related studies. There are a gap in the literature about how big data can be used in 
accessible tourism practice and studies. This study is trying to explore the use of 
big data applications and big data analytics in tourism and disability related practice 
and research, and illustrating the potential of using big data applications and analytics 
for accessible travel and tourism practice and studies.

\section{Tourism and Big data}
Most activities in the tourism industry had been generating a huge amount of data for
several years. Booking flight tickets, reserving a hotel room and renting a car all
leaves a data trail \cite{Shafiee16}. These data could add up to more than hundred of
terabytes or petabytes structured data in the conventional databases \cite{akerkar2012}.
Discussions of travel planning on online travel community, status updates and posts on
social media like Facebook and Twitter, compliments and compliant on review websites like TripAdvisor
constructs more challenging and live unstructured data that arrives at a much
faster pace than a conventional database \cite{akerkar2012}. Tourism practitioners are
trying to understand tourists' behavior by accepting and analyzing these big data 
\cite{Shafiee16}.

Tourists in the digital age often use a variety of tools to access information that
the tourism industry or other users have provided \cite{XIANG2015120}. A tourist
produces a high volume of data when they are searching for travel websites, reporting
issues on mobile applications, sharing traffic information in the cities, searching and
posting on social media, taking and sharing photos, reporting experience on travel
websites and social media \cite{akerkar2012, Shafiee16}. All these data that are
produced constantly can demonstrate tourists' motivation, interests, and their
planning patterns and so on \cite{XIE2017101}.

Previous studies have demonstrated several different usage and formats of big data in
the travel and tourism industry \cite{XIE2017101}. Social media is one of them that
has a huge effect on the tourism industry. Social media includes social networks,
review sites, blogs, media sharing, and wikis \cite{XIANG2015120}. The exceptional
growth of these data sources has inspired companies and institutions to come up with 
new strategies to understand the socio-economic phenomenon in various
fields \cite{Shafiee16}. Discussions and information sharing on social media are
considered as electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) that has in some degree substituted
tradition face-to-face word-of-mouth (WOM) for information exchange of tourist
experience \cite{chung2009}. 

\section{Disability and Big Data}
There are many different definition of disabilities from different organizations. The most cited official
definition is the 1976 definition of the World Health Organization \cite{Appleyard2005}: ``An impairment is
any loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological or anatomical structure or function; a disability
is any restriction or lack (resulting from an impairment) of ability to perform an activity in the manner
or within the range considered normal for a human being; a handicap is a disadvantage for a given
individual, resulting from an impairment or a disability, that prevents the fulfillment of a role that is
considered normal (depending on age, gender and social and cultural factors) for that individual''. While
people with disabilities are those people who have limitations in their actions or activities resulting
from physical or mental impairments, however, there are many types and levels of disabilities and their
actions and activities are affected differently by their disabilities \cite{Appleyard2005}. The complexity
of disabilities presents difficulties and challenges to accommodate the different needs of people with
disabilities and improve their qualities of life \cite{Datapop}. 

The number of individuals living with some sensory or cognitive impairment or assisting an affected person is enormous \cite{Riga13}. Researchers has been using disability informatics to better understand people with disabilities. Disability informatics is a sub-specialty of health informatics that is defined as ``any application that
collects, manages, and distributes information that are related to people with disabilities, as well as to
care givers (including familiar members and health care providers) and rehabilitation professionals''
\cite{Appleyard2005}. Disability informatics is closely related to other health informatics areas such as
medical informatics, public health informatics and consumer health informatics, because people with
disabilities usually have some secondary medical condition such as poor health status and increased
personal health care needs. 

Gather medical and health information can help to better understand and
accommodate people with disabilities \cite{Riga13}. A study from the early 2000 has identified the
potential of public health informatics for prevention at all vulnerable points in the causal chains leading
to disability and proposed that  applications should not be restricted to particular social, behavioral,
or environmental contexts, but in a more global context \cite{Yasnoff}.  

Another previous research has
designed and deployed an extended version of Artemis system (a cloud system designed to acquire data and
store physiological data of clinical information for real-time analytics) in a hospital. They have
identified that high speed physiological data produced at intensive care units as big data, and the proper
use of such data can promote health, reduce mortality and disability rates of critical condition patients
and create new cloud-based health analytics \cite{Khazaei14}. Research also has shown that many
disabilities are genetic, therefore, bioinformatics has implications in the education of genetic screening
and gen therapy treatments in the future \cite{Appleyard2005}.

People with disabilities usually need some 
assistive technology in their daily life. These technology that assist them to perform basic physical and 
social functions. The use information technology and assistive applications in disability informatics are 
categorized into three areas: virtual, personal, physical. Virtual environment refers to use of digital technologies like website and the Internet \cite{Appleyard2005}. 
Personal Environment refer to having a safe personal environment for people with disabilities. Safety monitoring and health monitor devices are essential in this personal environment, which enables a safer  personal environment and also provide health information for their medical care providers
 \cite{Appleyard2005}. However the ethic of such health monitor devices are always in debate, some believe
 it can be an invasion of privacy and a restriction of personal freedom, others hold the ground that its
 main purpose is to help people with disease or disabilities, since it can alert their caregiver if the
 individual are exposed to harm (such as a person with mental disability and has a history of self-harming,
 these device can prevent unwanted behavior) \cite{cunningham2017cloud}. 
People with disability also need help in their physical environment. Since the American Disabilities Act passed in the 1990s, the accessibility of physical environment has been
improved in a great degree. However, people with disabilities still would meet some barrier and problem, 
one of them is the lack of curb cuts. Assistive information technologies has been developed in an effort to
solve this problem. One of them is MAGUS, which is a project using geographical information system to inform 
users about wheelchair accessibility in urban areas \cite{Appleyard2005}

 The contribution of Big data and cloud computing have been recognized and accepted by researchers in health informatics \cite{7047725}. The potential of big data and cloud computing for disability informatics and for people with disabilities has 
been explored by a few researchers and organizations. Data-Pop Alliance is one of the organization has recognized 
the big data and potential for study and help people with disabilities for disability informatics and people 
with disabilities \cite{Datapop}. Their research has categorized three type of big data source used across disability
research: exhaust data (mobile-based data, financial transaction, transportation and online trace), digital 
content (social media and crowed-sourced/online content), and sensing data (physical and remote) \cite{Datapop}. 
They also provided the potential for some of these data sources, for example, researchers can use transaction 
data to compare cost, availability, and use of services that offer accessible options (such as accessible hotel 
listings) \cite{Datapop}. They also suggested that researcher can use social media data to represent people with
disabilities as a network of interaction and using crow-sourcing to map the locations of accessible businesses 
and public places \cite{Datapop}. 
The organization has also identify four functions of big data on disability:descriptive, predictive, diagnostic 
and engagement. Descriptive function of big data is to describing and presenting the collected information such
as using location data to map workplaces that are accessible to people with disabilities \cite{Datapop}. 
Predictive function is making inferences based on collected information such as discovering trends in the 
growth of number of accessible businesses in a certain urban area, while the diagnostic function means
establishing and making recommendations on the basis of causal relations such as showing what can help 
increasing accessible business in a certain area \cite{Datapop}. Finally, the engagement function refer
to shaping dialogue within and between communities and with key stakeholders through communication of data \cite{Datapop}.


Cloud computing in combined with big data can also provide great opportunities for research and improvement of
quality of life for people with disabilities \cite{Caldwell2011}. The term cloud ``refers to everything a user may reach via the 
Internet, including services, storage, applications, and people'' \cite{Hoehl2010}. Depending on the type of 
using, the ``cloud'' can be use for different purpose, such as for companies, the cloud could be used for hosting
services so as to avoid the costs and difficulties associated with hosting one’s own servers and software and for
individuals, the could is often used as information storage \cite{Khazaei14}. Regardless of the types of usages 
for cloud, the end using must still access the information and services residing in the cloud through device like
a smart phone or computer \cite{Hoehl2010}. Cloud computing has been used to provide more accessible virtual 
environment, especially Web access through project like WebAnywhere, which is a cloud based tool for blind using 
to access Internet \cite{Hoehl2010}. 

Cloud computing and big data analytics can also be helpful in health monitoring. The Artemis project mention earlier
provide a example of big data analytics and cloud computing usage in health monitoring, by creating new cloud-base
health analytics solutions \cite{Khazaei14}. Previous researchers have developed a mobile app to collect motion 
data of Parkinson's disease (PD) which is a disease resulting in mobility disorder using the smart phone 3D 
accelerometer and to send the data to a cloud service for storage, data processing, and PD symptoms severity
estimation, which provide an user-friendly and economically affordable system to monitor and assess the condition
of PD \cite{info:doi/10.2196/mhealth.3956}. Although this system is not for people with disabilities, but it 
provided potentials for similar systems to be developed for different kind of disabilities. 

Another application of cloud computing and big data in assistive technology is the CloudCast platform, which is a 
cloud-based speech recognition services that can be used for many assistive technology application for people
with speech difficulties and hearing impairment, it also facilitate the collection of speech data required for
the machine learning techniques \cite{cunningham2017cloud}. Similar to Alexa Voice Service, it provide reliable 
speech recognition which can be used with assistive devices for people with hearing impairments, but CloudCast
platform also provide customization for assistive technology applications benefiting users with speech 
impairment \cite{cunningham2017cloud}. This research provided a great example of using big data and cloud 
computing in combine to solve a certain problem for people with disabilities (in this case it is barriers for speech impairment). 

\section{Accessible Transportation and Big data}

An inaccessible transport network prevents many people from going to school or studying, working,
going to the doctor, meeting friends, going shopping or to the cinema and other activities that
are taken for granted, especially for people with disabilities, an inaccessible transport
network would left them dependent and confined in their own home \cite{Ama}. More importantly an
inaccessible transport network would also prevent people with disabilities to
travel for business or leisure \cite{milo}.
Older adults, people with disabilities, individuals in low-income households, especially 
those living in rural areas can face significant mobility challenges \cite{moya2016dynamic}. 

Concerns about getting into an accident, congestion,
price of travel, access to transit, and lack of walkways are important issues for a large
percentage of the population, but they tend to be more important for people with
disabilities \cite{moya2016dynamic}. For today's travel and transportation businesses,
it is important to address the issue of inclusion, which is the potential to enable 
a broader range of  people to use
transportation infrastructure regardless of their individual abilities or disabilities
\cite{milo}. 

Accessible travel includes not only the point-to-point transportation (such as air
travel, flights), but also the accessibility of destination \cite{Ama,DARCY2010816,milo}.
For people with disability to actually make the trip, they will also require booking for
transportation to be accessible. This section is going to explore the implementation of big
data analytics and applications in air travel, online booking and destination
accessibility. 

\subsection{Big data Analytics and Applications for Airline and Online Reservation}

\subsubsection{Airline and Big data}

The airline industry is very familiar with big data use in their daily operations and market research. Airline companies have been using their big data which is the large volume of structured information that has been produced internally \cite{MIAH2017} to analyze prices of plane ticket. Moreover, airlines have optimized the details of planning for the crew and routing \cite{Shafiee16}. 

Previous studies in airline network used Big Data mined from the U.S. air transportation system over the years from 1998–2014 to characterize the network's behavior and determine what internal and/or external drivers result in structural changes to the airline network \cite{7777957}. Airline delay patents has also been studied with the help of big data by identifying by the number of late arrivals as a percent of total operations \cite{Sor}. 

In another previous study, researchers used data from 2006 to 2008 in order to provides the result about the total flight delay for a specific period of time caused due to climate, security, carrier, National Aviation System, Arrival and Departure based on total number of flights getting delayed over in the given period of time \cite{Sor}. In the study, the authors used time series analysis along with the integration of heterogeneous database to identify and achieve the Airline Seasonal Delay which is implemented and visualized in R, they were able to identify a trend line to provide the insights for the aviation industry to take future measures to avoid delays and manage them \cite{Sor}.

Airline studies have also used big data analytics on passenger reviews data.The advance development of social media and mobile helped the passengers to post reviews in a ubiquitous way, allow them post real time feedback over Facebook, Twitter on airports, airlines, and other travel providers \cite{CHEN2016285}. However, passengers' review can be really complex since travel activities usually involve multiple parties, therefore, the travel domain application systems are also typically managed by different stakeholders like airlines, airports, travel agencies, security and other services providers like cars, bus, trains, hotels, events. In order to provide a holistic approach to manage complex passenger reviews with data gathering, processing and disseminating, a previous study has proposed a reference architecture to manag passenger reviews where multiple stakeholders are involved by using data lakes, which can store, manage and analyze structured and unstructured data with cheaper cost, well-distributed, open sourced and powerful set of tools.

\subsubsection{Big Data Applications and Online Reservation}
Nowadays, the majority of the travel planning process happens online. Tourists would use a variety of tourism website, search engines, and reservation domains. The Internet also plays an important part at during and post travel stage, as tourists report issues on mobile applications, share traffic information in the cities, search and post on social media, take and share photos, report experience on travel
websites and social media \cite{akerkar2012, Shafiee16}. 

Previous studies in relation to disability informatics  demonstrated 
the profound positive impact of  that the digital revolution on the life
of people with disability by empowering them with the help of digital technologies \cite{Appleyard2005}. However, there are still access issues in the digital world, the most urgent one is the use of the World Wide Web (WWW or Web). The Web has always had a strong awareness and been advocacy for accessibility since early on in its evolution \cite{Appleyard2005}. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) had passed the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines in the late 1990s \cite{Appleyard2005}. 

A number of assistive technologies were designed to help people with disabilities to use the Web. For example BBC Education Text to Speech Internet Enhancer (BESTIE) is a CGI Perl script that can help people with disabilities who are using text-to-speech systems for Web browsing to modified the web page removing images, Java and Javascript code
that may cause difficulties to understand the BBC web page content \cite{Erra}. However, the limitation of BESTIE is that it is only compatible with BBC website. Other researchers also came up with Personalizable Accessible Navigation (PAN), which is a set of edge services designed to improve Web pages accessibility which allow  personalization and the opportunities to select multiple profiles, making it compatible for web as well as mobile devices \cite{info:doi/10.2196/mhealth.3956}. 

The online sector of the tourism industry has quickly adopted big data applications to better understand the need of customer and to improve online experience for customers \cite{akerkar2012}. The online sector of the industry include  meta-search engines (like Google), online travel agencies (like Expedia) and some information website companies that
distribute tourism information (TripAdvisor)\cite{MIAH2017}. Amadeus, a tourism company known for its global distribution system, has developed a program ``Amadeus Airline Cloud Availability'' that can generated special result and increase search for its customers\cite{Shafiee16}.

Travel domain companies like Marriott, Southwest airline, and Amtrak also developed assistive devices specially for people with disabilities to use when browsing their websites. These assistive technologies can help people with disabilities to navigate online reservation website, and help them to independently booking their travel reservations for hotels, restaurants, airplane tickets and attraction passes.

These assistive devices was design to help people with disabilities to have access to the Web. However,  current web accessibility standards do not respect disability as a complex and culturally contingent interaction. The needs and demand of people with different types of disabilities are certainly not the same and this make it hard to understand and pinpoint the real needs for people with disabilities to access the Web. Researchers have proposed to use big data to better understand of the relation between disability and technology and recognized the difference of disabled people in the “Global South” where different contexts constitute different disabilities and different experiences of web access \cite{Appleyard2005}.

\subsection{Transport Network Accessibility and Big data}
Accessibility in the transport network are different defined than travel accessibility, since the urban accessibility is focus on provide access of transportation and transit to general public, not specifically people with disabilities \cite{moya2016dynamic}. Accessibility has always been a key concept in urban and regional planning for its capacity to link the activities of people and businesses to the possibilities of reaching them effectively. The accessibility of the transport network is already challenging for general public, for people with disabilities who requires special needs, it become a tremendous and difficult barrier, because they are required to make rapid, real-time decisions that are
especially difficult for special needs populations. Therefore, previous studies using big data on urban accessibility can provide some potentials for travel accessibility studies \cite{Barbeau}.

For Urban an regional planning, accessibility represent traffic capacity to link the activities of people and business to the possibilities of reaching them effectively \cite{moya2016dynamic}. Accessibility is defined as "a dynamic attribute of locations that varies over time due to changes in the transport network and in the attractiveness of destinations for certain activities" \cite{moya2016dynamic}. Since the emergence of big data generated by social media, smart phones, satellite navigation system and other technologies,  the information on transport networks has improved conclusively in recent years \cite{Barbeau}. Navigation companies such as TomTom; websites and applications like Bing Maps, Google Map; collaborative projects like Open-Street-Map; the public availability of Transit Feed Specification and data from other transit authorities opens up a rapid growing field of research on real time and time-of-day variations in private and public transit accessibility \cite{moya2016dynamic}. These companies and institutions have increasingly detailed systems with information on the features of roads and public transport networks, and their databases include information on speed variations on the roads and the frequencies of passage in public transport networks, all of which contribute a more efficient and dynamic vision to urban accessibility studies \cite{moya2016dynamic}.

However, there is very little research using these new information sources in studies on urban accessibility. Previous studies utilized data obtained from global positioning system devices to calculate speeds, congestion levels and accessibility conditions at  different times of day (morning, midday, evening,), other studies analyzed data from Be-Mobile system (which provided the geo-located positions of 400,000 vehicles equipped with tracking devices) to calculate car travel times \cite{moya2016dynamic}. 

Previous studies also have gathered and analyzed information from web services (such as Google map API) to calculate travel times between origins and destinations. These studies were able to use new information source and big data provided by the development of technologies to retrieve information about local locations and traffic condition for local facilities like groceries, malls, restaurants, banks, recreation centers and others, and estimate accessibility by car, walking, cycling and public transit options \cite{moya2016dynamic}. Previous research also used data from social media such as Twitter in combined with data from satellite navigation system (like TomTom) to provide a dynamic approach and obtain profiles that highlight the daily variations in accessibility in urban cities, identify real time influence of congestion and population location changes, by providing different accessibility profiles from different transport zone, the researchers was able to analyze the relationship between the performance of the transport network and the attractiveness of the destination \cite{moya2016dynamic}. Although this study is not design to provide information for people with disability, but such dynamic approach using real time big data can also benefit people with disabilities and help them identify places to go in the city and the most accessible route to the attractions. 

Another study also proposed and developed a travel assistance device for people with disabilities by using real time data from global positioning system. According to this study, recent advancements in mobile technology enabled smart phones with global positioning system provide a variety of real-time location-based services and data. The researchers designed , implemented and tested a travel assistance device (TAD) that is designed to help transit riders with special needs using public transportation \cite{Barbeau}. This travel assistance device provides the people with disabilities customized real-time audio, visual and tactile prompts for exiting the transit vehicle by announcing ``Get ready''and ``Pull the cord now!'', based on  its real-time assisted GPS data provided by the embedded GPS chip in the cell phone \cite{Barbeau}.  This device is a
navigation software program designed to prompt individuals via a cell phone to exit the bus at a pre-set location. Once the software is downloaded to the cell phone,
parents, travel trainers, or other authorized individuals can access the web management
page to schedule bus routes to be transmitted to the cell phone.  The system also provides alerts to riders, their caretakers and travel trainers when the rider with disabilities deviates from the planned route. With a website allowing easy access for the design and planning of new trip itineraries, the device allows authorized personnel (usually caregivers, family members) to monitor the rider’s location in real-time from any computer \cite{Barbeau}. 

The travel assistance device was catered to the needs of people with disabilities, increasing their level of independence and their care-takers security. This travel assistance device represented beneficial practice for people with disabilities, however, there are still many challenge for the development of such device or services. One of the main challenge is that different needs of people with disabilities making it difficult to complete satisfy and assist people with different disabilities. Since the device proposed by this study is still at experimental stage and their test sample are limited, although through the test, the device was proved to be easy to use, it still might pose as a challenge for other people with disabilities, especially people with cognitive limitations. 


\section{Promise of big data in travel accessibility}
\subsection{Internet of Thing and Travel Assistive Technology}
\subsubsection{Internet of Thing Assistive Technology and Potentials for Travel use}
Assistive devices or technology for people with disabilities are not a new concept. Assistive devices refers to ``any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially off the shelf, modifed, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities'', for examples, canes, crutches, walkers, wheelchairs, and shower chairsm, hearings aids, visual aids, other hardware, and software that improve ICT access or
communication capacities are all assistive devices \cite{Barbeau, Shah}. People with disabilities are usually seen as depend, and in need of help from caregiver or family members. However, with the technological growth that has been seen in the last 20 years, a wide array of devices have been adapted, created, and utilized with the potential to create independence for individuals with disabilities. Virtual reality, sensor monitoring devices, smart phone have all been used to assist those who require assistance in their day to day lives \cite{moya2016dynamic}.  

Older adults and individuals with physical, sensory, and mental/cognitive disabilities encounter many barriers to inclusion and accessing various opportunities and services that the society has to offer \cite{Shah}. In order to overcome these barriers, people with disabilities needs some forms of assistive technologies or devices. Traditional technologies has many challenges, however,  with the development of technology, the Internet of Things (IoT), smart homes, smart buildings,
smart cities, and other smart environments can overcome some of these challenges due to their prevalence and diverse capabilities.

One of human's fundamental needs is the mobility and capability of independently traveling around, including for people with physical disabilities and even blind or visually impaired individuals. In order for people with visual impairment to independently travel or moving around requires indoor and outdoor navigation capabilities, the blind and visually impaired people may rely on some type of AT to supplement their navigational abilities \cite{Shah}. The advanced sensors of the smart phones can also be utilized in providing meaningful interactions with the environment for individuals with different abilities. A typical modern smart phone has more than twenty sensors. These sensors may include GPS-based systems that can be useful for outdoor navigation's, however in general, may lack the required precision and reliability for use by the blind or partially sighted individuals \cite{Shah}. 

``A promising line of works for navigation by the blind and partially sighted people is based on the use of Bluetooth beacons and audible instructions delivered
through an interface device, such as bone conduction earphones or smartphones. A
trial of such a system, “with 16 Bluetooth beacons providing pin-point accurate
indoor location mapping” for unassisted mobility in the London Underground has
been reported. The system is based on a mobile app, Wayfnder, that promises
to be an open platform promoting future developments. Bluetooth beacons are
employed to position the user by the app that provides audible directions to them
through a bone conduction earphone.
Microsoft, Guide Dogs, UK and several other organizations have also embarked
on expanding similar concepts to respond to the challenges that people with sight
loss face while navigating the cities. The developed technology includes an
easy to use app, SoundScape, that has features allowing the user to start a journey in
Orientate mode, and to explore or use Look Ahead mode, as well as to Find the Way
mode, which lets them stop at any point and check that they are heading in the right
direction using directional audio''. 

\subsubsection{The big data challenge of IoT AT}
``In the case of the IoT and smart
environments, the advances in sensor technologies and abilities for comprehensive
monitoring and surveillance have not been complemented by growth in other computing resources and interface technologies. While the progress is rapid in all of
these fronts, data availability still surpasses the processing and use capabilities. For
instance, real-time localization and navigation systems that can assist the blind or
visually impaired people to travel around, face two major related challenges. The
frst one is the allocation of computational resources that can process the large
amounts of data coming from multiple sensors and cameras, fast enough in a synchronized manner. The second issue relates to quick and real-time access to
dynamic datasets through interfaces that are appropriate for the user.Most IoT devices are
energy constrained, with small memory, limited processing power, and restrictive
communication capabilities. The sheer number of IoT devices, mandates the use of
IPv6, requiring integration of multi-technology networks and managing IPv4 and
IPv6 coexistence issues. Finding cost-effective solutions to all of these problems can be diffcult.
Another aspect of the AT adoption relates to its suitability in meeting the users’
needs and desires. A critical factor to consider is that some approaches ``…may have
technical merit, and may solve obvious problems, but still fail to address the complex
interplay of issues at work and to take the most appropriate approach to dealing with
these matters. Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that there may not even
be a ‘right’ problem to tackle. Flexibility cannot be overvalued'' In this
sense, to develop devices and services that are actually used, a holistic approach that
incorporates the mental state and wishes of the intended users, is required. Here
again, the lack of a comprehensive approach can result in products that only serve a
perceived or assumed need, rather than flling an actual gap. For instance, some may
simply ignore the mentality of an elderly, who may feel that they have no place to go,
even after subjecting themselves to the distresses associated with using an advanced
AT that may assist them with mobility or travel. Previous studies has mentioned a
the smart doorbell project which is meant to recognize
individuals at the door and notify the user through their mobile devices. The adoption and employment of such systems, clearly depends on the confidence of the user of
their error rate, as they do not want to miss anyone whom they like to let in. Some people may feel intimidated by the newer technologies such as those used
in the smart environments and the IoT-based AT. Most individuals are used to being
in control of their devices, whereas IoT-based AT and environments tend to automate processes, ironically, to alleviate the pressures of operating devices and appliances for the humans. A similar issue arises from the fast pace of the development
of such advanced technologies. The rapid technological advances, make the products and services obsolete, as the new improved versions become available at fast
rates. These rapid changes usually mean that the elderly or people with disability or dementia may miss out on obtaining the full benefts of these devices or services .
The costs, learning curves, or simply a lack of awareness can also mean that these
people may not use the new technologies. 


For people with disabilities, traveling can be very challenging, the challenge exist in indoor traveling, within community traveling (local travel), however, traveling long distance for business or leisure can be extremely complicated and taxing for people with disabilities. They usually would need some sort of assistive devices.

The emergence of new technologies such as Internet of Things 
and large scale wireless sensor systems enables the collection of data from 
an increasing volume and variety of networked sensors for analysis.

\subsection{Sentiment Analysis on Hotel reviews}
Sentiment analysis, which is also called opinion mining, is one of the most active
research areas in natural language processing \cite{opinion2014}. The aim of sentiment analysis is to define automatic tools able to extract subjective information from text in natural \cite{article} language, and to create structured and actionable knowledge to be used by either a decision support system or a decision maker. The sentiments of reviews, online reputation or online documents are usually categorized in positive, negative and (in some studies) neutral sentiments \cite{Garcia2012}. The main goal of the sentiment classification is to extract ``the global sentiment based on the subjectivity and the linguistic characteristics of the words within an unstructured text'' \cite{Garcia2012}. Therefore, sentiment analysis provided a framework to transform unstructured text to structured data, which make it strongly applicable to both the academic field \cite{Cam2013}. Because of the importance of sentiment analysis to business and society, it has spread from computer science to management science and the social sciences \cite{Pozzi}. As a social science field and business industry, tourism an travel studies have already been using sentiment analysis in the research.

The popularity of social media, especially review sites like TripAdvisor and blogs and wikis, leads to an enormous amount of personal reviews for travel-related information on the Web \cite{opinion2014}. More importantly, the information in these reviews is valuable to both tourists and travel and tourism practitioners for various understanding and planning processes \cite{YE20096527}. Previous studies have identified two primary approaches for sentiment analysis: methods based on the combination of lexical resources and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques; and machine learning approaches \cite{Garcia2012}. Since 2009, researchers have been using machine learning methods in the natural language processing (support vector machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes, and the N-gram model) to do sentiment analysis on TripAdvisor reviews \cite{YE20096527}. 
Their study analyzed online reviews related to travel destinations, using different supervised machine learning algorithms The
algorithms to evaluate the reviews about seven popular travel destinations in Europe and North America \cite{YE20096527}.

Thee etBlogAnalysis project developed a combined crawler /sentiment extraction application for the tourism industry, which used a simple and robust linguistic parsing methodology with information and terminology extraction methods in order to determine relevant utterances on expression level \cite{opinion2014}. It will also provide a warning for tourism operator such as a hotel, if too many negative entries have been generated by their reviewers \cite{Garcia2012}.

In tourism studies, sentiment analysis has been compared to traditional qualitative analytic methods. A previous study compared three alternative approaches for mining consumer sentiment (manual content coding, corpus-based semantic analysis, and stance-shift analysis) from large amounts of qualitative data found in online travel reviews \cite{Farm}. They applied three different approaches to study consumers' reaction to farm stays in order to demonstrate how large volumes of qualitative data can be analyzed quantitatively in a relatively efficient and reliable way \cite{Farm}.  Manual content coding is the same as traditional the content analysis approach involving two researchers collaborated in a manual coding process designed to extract consumer likes and dislikes from the qualitative data \cite{Farm}. According to the comparison, computer generated sentiment analysis such as stance-shift analysis processing on both syntax and lexicon assures the coding maintains the statement's context identifying what is important to the informants by the way they express their comments. Most importantly, stance-shift analysis does not categorize what the researcher thinks is important in reviewer's words \cite{Farm}. The study suggested by combining different approaches in sentiment analysis such as using stance-shift analysis first identifies the significant word segments then using corpus-based semantic analysis detects key themes in those segments helps uncover narrative themes of consumer experiences in large qualitative databases \cite{Farm}.

Sentiment analysis will help researchers to better understand people's travel experience, however, there are few studies have been done to identify demographic information of the reviewer and compare the sentiment analysis result across different demographic. A recent invention present the possibility of identifying demographic characteristics while conducting sentiment analysis. The invention consist of a product or service review to determine demographic information of the reviewer \cite{Bhatt2014}. A sentiment text analysis is performed on the product or service review, wherein the sentiment text analysis examines the product or service review to determine a sentiment of the product or service review. The sentiment of the product or service review is categorized based on the demographic information of the reviewer \cite{Bhatt2014}. This invention present the promise of using sentiment analysis on the travel experience of people with disabilities. However, challenges still remain for research of UGC generated by people with disabilities, such as the challenge presented by privacy concerns of personal data online \cite{lazar}. 


\subsection{Recommender System}
Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) have been transforming tourism business
globally and revolutionizing the world of Tourism. It transforms tourism from a
labor-intensive to an information-intensive industry \cite{Williams201787}.
Tourists influence by the developments in search engines, network speed and capacity 
have been using use technologies for better planning and experiencing their
trips \cite{XIE2017101}. In addition, ICTs enable travelers to access reliable and
accurate information and make reservations faster, cheaper and more convenient than
the traditional way \cite{chung2009}.

The development of ICTs also enables Internet users to both create and distribute
information (especially multimedia information), which is called user-generated 
content (UGC) or consumer-generated content (CGC) \cite{chung2009}.

Nowadays tourists faces a very challenging task of trip preparation because of the
huge amount of information available on the Web about tourism and leisure activities.
Recommender systems becomes essential for tourists and tourism operates. For tourists,
recommender systems can be a useful tools to help them make decision for travel
planning, such as the choices of destinations, attractions, accommodations and
restaurants. As for tourism operators, it can be a great marketing opportunities for
them to reach a variety of targeted potential consumers. Complex problems such as
automated planning, semantic knowledge management, group recommendation or
context-awareness have by now been heavily studied in this area \cite{morenorecommender}. 

There are already several tourism recommender system available for general public. TIP and Heracles systems provide recommendation service through mobile devices for tourism, through implement hybrid algorithms to calculate tourist preferences, using the defined tourist profile and location data \cite{morenorecommender}. Crumpet provides new information delivery services for a variety of different tourist population based on location aware services, personalized user interaction, accessible multi-media mobile communication and smart component-based middleware that uses Multi-Agent Technology \cite{Santos2018}. CATIS is a Web based tourist information system using context-awareness, which include context elements such as location, time of day, speed, direction of travel and personal preferences. This system provided information to tourists relevant to his or her location and time \cite{Santos2018}. TravelWithFriends using group recommendation service, the first step is to build a recommendation list for each user and to merge them to obtain a destinations shortlist. Afterwards, each group member rates all these options and a Borda count is used to determine the best five destinations to be recommended \cite{morenorecommender}.

Classical recommender systems filter the domain items according to a particular user, using his or her demographic data, past ratings or purchasing history \cite{LU201512}. This approach are used to recommend specific items such as books, songs or films \cite{LU201512}. However, it may not be suitable for travel activities, since most of time travel is an activity that involves a group of people (such as family members, friends). Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the different preferences of all members of travel group when providing recommendations \cite{morenorecommender}. Previous studies and technology reports have identified two primary options for group recommendation: the first one is to merge the lists of items recommended to each group member, or creating a group profile with everyone’s preferences and then compute a single list of group recommendations \cite{Garcia2009}. The second option’s first step is the same as the previous option, by constructing of a list of recommendations for each group member. In a second step though, an automatic consensus-reaching process is applied, in which individual preferences are continuously updated until a high degree of agreement between all the group members is reached \cite{Garcia2009}.

The use of semantic domain knowledge in the recommendation process has heavily increased in recent years. Previous studies have defined the semantic similarity between two concepts is as ``the ratio between the number of different ancestors and the total number of ancestors of both concepts’’ \cite{morenorecommender}. The items to be recommended are clustered according to this semantic similarity and the recommendation procedure selects the best item from random clusters \cite{Santos2018}. Previous study has shown that this procedure keeps the accuracy and increases the diversity of the results \cite{morenorecommender}. Semantic information can also be used to determine the items to be recommended in a personalized visit to a museum or destinations, by using a shortest-path semantic distance to determine which museum objects or attractions should be recommended to the user \cite{morenorecommender}. 

Previous study also proposed a hybrid tourism recommendation system for persons suffering from physical or intellectual limitation. This proposed recommendation system is not simply trying to improve experience, but to create in users the confidence that despite of their limitations they can visit and experience certain places without being afraid, and to help them to live a touristic experience. By identifying the user’s functionality and point of interest (POI) accessibility level, the system models a user stereotype profile, which represent user’s related knowledge (which is layered with several knowledge representation structures and models shown in Fig. 1) and produce an accurate touristic recommendation plan \cite{Santos2018}. The study represent itself as a opportunity to provided needed information to people with disabilities through a hybrid tourism recommendation system.
