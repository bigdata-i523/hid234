  abstract  = {The importance of contextual information has been recognized by researchers and practitioners in many disciplines, including e-commerce personalization, information retrieval, ubiquitous and mobile computing, data mining, marketing, and management. While a substantial amount of research has already been performed in the area of recommender systems, many existing approaches focus on recommending the most relevant items to users without taking into account any additional contextual information, such as time, location, or the company of other people (e.g., for watching movies or dining out). There is growing understanding that relevant contextual information does matter in recommender systems and that it is important to take this information into account when providing recommendations. We discuss the general notion of context and how it can be modeled in recommender systems. We also discuss three popular algorithmic paradigms---contextual pre-filtering, post-filtering, and modeling---for incorporating contextual information into the recommendation process, and survey recent work on context-aware recommender systems. We also discuss important directions for future research.},

This method makes recommendations based on the group tastes, their demographic classification and the places visited by the users in former trips. The group recommendation is computed from individual personal recommendations through the use of techniques such as aggregation, intersection or incremental intersection. This method is implemented as an extension of the e-Tourism tool, which is a user-adapted tourism and leisure application, whose main component is the Generalist Recommender System Kernel (GRSK), a domain-independent taxonomy-driven search engine that manages the group recommendation.},

Travelers are increasingly using ORs to inform them about accommodations and other tourism-related products. As such, it is important to improve our understanding of the behavioral consequences of e-word-of-mouth. In this article, we adopt the elaboration likelihood model to identify what influences travelers to adopt information from ORs in their decision making. We measure the influence of six dimensions of information quality that are part of the central route and two dimensions that are associated with the peripheral route of persuasion. The results of this study reveal that product ranking, information accuracy, information value-added, information relevance, and information timeliness are strong predictors of travelers’ adoption of information from ORs on accommodations. These results imply that high-involvement travelers adopt both central (information quality) and peripheral (product ranking) routes when they process information from ORs. },

Currently, existing approaches can be split into two main groups: methods based on the combination of lexical resources and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques; and machine learning approaches. This paper introduces the use of lexical databases for Sentiment Analysis of user reviews in Spanish for the accommodation and food and beverage sectors. A global sentiment score has been calculate based on the negative and positive words which appear in the review and using the mentioned lexicon database. The algorithm has been tested with short users online reviews acquired from TripAdvisor. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
