  abstract = { Why are older adults reluctant to adopt new technology, such as the Internet, given its potential to improve the quality of their lives? We review evidence indicating that attitudes and abilities are among the most powerful predictors of technology use. We conclude that normative age-related changes in ability must be taken into account when designing products and training programs for aging adults, and we discuss new tools to support designers. The most promising emerging technologies likely lie in training cognitive abilities and augmenting or substituting for impaired abilities. We discuss reasons to expect that the lag in technology adoption between younger and older adults may lessen but will not disappear in future generations. },

  abstract = {This paper considers the main aspects and questions that are required to be asked by any designer of residences that include technology designed to support the lives of disabled people. It seeks to reframe the design process to extend the concepts of 'inclusive' and 'universal' design within the social context of designing for people with a wide range of disabilities. Designing 'smart homes' or homes that contain elements of 'smart home' technology for disabled or older people is not different from designing the home for people without any form of impairment on the one hand. On the other hand, there is a perceptual shift that is required in order to ensure needs are met from all stakeholders. There is a need to determine the needs of the occupant(s) and reflect these needs within the overall design. This paper addresses the main questions that arise from the design process as well as discuss the role of cultural probes in enhancing the design.},

There is a great need to develop alternative cloud-based care supports as traditional methods of care become more difficult to obtain. Contrary to some perspectives, many people with I/DD are capable of using cloud computing technology; they and their families are a viable consumer market. Advances in civil rights and self-determination principles regarding people with I/DD have secured their acknowledged position as a natural constituency of society; however, too often they are left out of consideration of social design. Excluding the needs of people with I/DD in cloud computing consideration, design and structure may put them at risk for further marginalization in human society. This paper discusses the profile of the global I/DD population, self-determination principles, and family perspectives of technology.},

  abstract = {Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most prevalent movement disorder of the central nervous system, and affects more than 6.3 million people in the world. The characteristic motor features include tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and impaired postural stability. Current therapy based on augmentation or replacement of dopamine is designed to improve patients' motor performance but often leads to levodopa-induced adverse effects, such as dyskinesia and motor fluctuation. Clinicians must regularly monitor patients in order to identify these effects and other declines in motor function as soon as possible. Current clinical assessment for Parkinson's is subjective and mostly conducted by brief observations made during patient visits. Changes in patients' motor function between visits are hard to track and clinicians are not able to make the most informed decisions about the course of therapy without frequent visits. Frequent clinic visits increase the physical and economic burden on patients and their families. Objective: In this project, we sought to design, develop, and evaluate a prototype mobile cloud-based mHealth app, ``PD Dr'', which collects quantitative and objective information about PD and would enable home-based assessment and monitoring of major PD symptoms. Methods: We designed and developed a mobile app on the Android platform to collect PD-related motion data using the smartphone 3D accelerometer and to send the data to a cloud service for storage, data processing, and PD symptoms severity estimation. To evaluate this system, data from the system were collected from 40 patients with PD and compared with experts' rating on standardized rating scales. Results: The evaluation showed that PD Dr could effectively capture important motion features that differentiate PD severity and identify critical symptoms. For hand resting tremor detection, the sensitivity was .77 and accuracy was .82. For gait difficulty detection, the sensitivity was .89 and accuracy was .81. In PD severity estimation, the captured motion features also demonstrated strong correlation with PD severity stage, hand resting tremor severity, and gait difficulty. The system is simple to use, user friendly, and economically affordable. Conclusions: The key contribution of this study was building a mobile PD assessment and monitoring system to extend current PD assessment based in the clinic setting to the home-based environment. The results of this study proved feasibility and a promising future for utilizing mobile technology in PD management. },
