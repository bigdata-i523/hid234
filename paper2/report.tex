\section{Introduction}
People with disabilities are a group that has been overlooked for a long time. Some might question that why we should care about people with disability. According to UTHealth, as of February 2015,there are about a billion people with disabilities in the world and in the United States alone, there are 56.7 million people with disabilities \cite{Lex}. Notably, the number of people with disabilities is expected to increase as a result of increasing life-span, decreases in communicable diseases, improved medical technology, and improved child mortality \cite{SMITH1987376}. According to United Nation, people with disabilities are the largest minority group in the world \cite{Appleyard2005,DARCY2010816,Lex}. While some forms of disabilities might be genetic, but temporary or permanent disabilities can happen to anyone, such as spinal cord injury after car accident, or limited mobility at later stage of life \cite{Lex}. Therefore, improving the living condition and quality of life for people with disabilities are extremely important to everyone.

There are many different definition of disabilities from different organizations. The most cited official definition is the 1976 definition of the World Health Organization \cite{Appleyard2005}: ``An impairment is any loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological or anatomical structure or function; a disability is any restriction or lack (resulting from an impairment) of ability to perform an activity in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being; a handicap is a disadvantage for a given individual, resulting from an impairment or a disability, that prevents the fulfillment of a role that is considered normal (depending on age, sex and social and cultural factors) for that individual''. While people with disabilities are those people who have limitations in their actions or activities resulting from physical or mental impairments, however, there are many types and levels of disabilities and their actions and activities are affected differently by their disabilities \cite{Appleyard2005}. This presents difficulties and challenges to accommodate the different needs of people with disabilities and improve their qualities of life \cite{Datapop}. 

The development of digital technology has changed many people's lives, the life of people with disabilities has also been improved by technology. People with poor visions can using cell phones to contact others, access information online with screen readers. People with hearing problems can text other people with cell phone. This study is trying to help people with disabilities from a health informatics prospective, and looking into how big data and edge computing can help monitor and evaluate and understand people with disabilities and help improve their quality of life. 

\section{Types of Disability}
Disability has different function types and levels of degrees, while these types are not completely exclusive, most of functional types of disability can be categorized into three groups: mobility, sensory, and cognitive \cite{Appleyard2005}. This section provides a simple overview of these three functional types of disabilities and its challenges for people with disabilities. 

Mobility problems are faced by people with physical motor disabilities (such as spinal cord injury after traumatic injury), and people have impaired muscle controls \cite{SMITH1987376}. These people might have problem using technologies than are design to assist them such as wheelchairs or computer interface aids \cite{Appleyard2005}.

Sensory disability includes both visual and aural impairment \cite{Appleyard2005}. Their conditions can range from correctable (such as using eyeglass or hearing aids) to not correctable (such as blind or deaf) \cite{Riga13}. Braille has been traditionally used by people with visual impairment, but now was replaced by technology such as voice synthesis and screen readers \cite{Riga13}.

Cognitive disabilities in general refer to people with cognitive impairment who have difficulties than an average individual with one or more types of mental tasks involving language, memory, perception, problem-solving, hand-eye coordination, conceptualizing, attention and executive functions\cite{Appleyard2005}. 

\section{Disability informatics}
Disability informatics is a sub-specialty health informatics that is defined as any application that collects, manages, and distributes information that are related to people with disabilities, as well as to care givers (including familiar members and health care providers) and rehabilitation professionals \cite{Appleyard2005}. Disability informatics is closely related to medical informatics, public health informatics an consumer health informatics, because people with disabilities usually have some secondary medical condition such as poor health status and increased personal health care needs. Gather medical and health information can help to better understand and accommodate people with disabilities. A previous research has designed and deployed an extended version of Artemis system (a cloud system designed to acquire data and store physiological data of clinical information for real-time analytics) in a hospital. They have identified that high speed physiological data produced at intensive care units as big data, and the proper use of such data can promote health, reduce mortality and disability rates of critical condition patients and create new cloud-based health analytics \cite{Khazaei14}.
Research also has shown that many disabilities are genetic, therefore, bioinformatics has implications in the education of genetic screening and gen therapy treatments in the future \cite{Appleyard2005}.

The two main components in disability informatics are assistive technology and information technology. 

The information technology applications and issues in disability informatics are categorized into four areas: virtual, personal, physical and social/intellectual.
