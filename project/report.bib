While a substantial amount of research has already been performed in the area of recommender systems, many existing approaches focus on recommending the most relevant items to users without taking into account any additional contextual information, such as time, location, or the company of other people (e.g., for watching movies or dining out). There is growing understanding that relevant contextual information does matter in recommender systems and that it is important to take this information into account when providing recommendations. We discuss the general notion of context and how it can be modeled in recommender systems. We also discuss three popular algorithmic paradigms---contextual pre-filtering, post-filtering, and modeling---for incorporating contextual information into the recommendation process, and survey recent work on context-aware recommender systems. We also discuss important directions for future research.},

This method makes recommendations based on the group tastes, their demographic classification and the places visited by the users in former trips. The group recommendation is computed from individual personal recommendations through the use of techniques such as aggregation, intersection or incremental intersection. This method is implemented as an extension of the e-Tourism tool, which is a user-adapted tourism and leisure application, whose main component is the Generalist Recommender System Kernel (GRSK), a domain-independent taxonomy-driven search engine that manages the group recommendation.},

  abstract = { Online reviews (ORs) are continuing to foster a renewed spread of word-of-mouth in the travel industry. Travelers are increasingly using ORs to inform them about accommodations and other tourism-related products. As such, it is important to improve our understanding of the behavioral consequences of e-word-of-mouth. In this article, we adopt the elaboration likelihood model to identify what influences travelers to adopt information from ORs in their decision making. We measure the influence of six dimensions of information quality that are part of the central route and two dimensions that are associated with the peripheral route of persuasion. The results of this study reveal that product ranking, information accuracy, information value-added, information relevance, and information timeliness are strong predictors of travelers’ adoption of information from ORs on accommodations. These results imply that high-involvement travelers adopt both central (information quality) and peripheral (product ranking) routes when they process information from ORs. },

Currently, existing approaches can be split into two main groups: methods based on the combination of lexical resources and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques; and machine learning approaches. This paper introduces the use of lexical databases for Sentiment Analysis of user reviews in Spanish for the accommodation and food and beverage sectors. A global sentiment score has been calculate based on the negative and positive words which appear in the review and using the mentioned lexicon database. The algorithm has been tested with short users online reviews acquired from TripAdvisor. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Now and again it takes off for the high skies and on occasion, it plunges to ground levels. In the middle of these highs and lows, lies the tale of the business -- of its survival, of the new and rising patterns that fuel its development. The issue of carrier deferrals, as measured by the quantity generally landings as a percent of aggregate operations, has been of expanding significance as of late as a large portion of the populace picks air go as a favored method of transportation. This paper provides the result about the total flight delay for a specific period of time caused due to climate, security, carrier, NAS, arrival and departure based on total number of flights getting delayed over the past few years (2006, 2007 and 2008).

There is a great need to develop alternative cloud-based care supports as traditional methods of care become more difficult to obtain. Contrary to some perspectives, many people with I/DD are capable of using cloud computing technology; they and their families are a viable consumer market. Advances in civil rights and self-determination principles regarding people with I/DD have secured their acknowledged position as a natural constituency of society; however, too often they are left out of consideration of social design. Excluding the needs of people with I/DD in cloud computing consideration, design and structure may put them at risk for further marginalization in human society. This paper discusses the profile of the global I/DD population, self-determination principles, and family perspectives of technology.},

Designing 'smart homes' or homes that contain elements of 'smart home' technology for disabled or older people is not different from designing the home for people without any form of impairment on the one hand. On the other hand, there is a perceptual shift that is required in order to ensure needs are met from all stakeholders. There is a need to determine the needs of the occupant(s) and reflect these needs within the overall design. This paper addresses the main questions that arise from the design process as well as discuss the role of cultural probes in enhancing the design.},

  abstract = {Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most prevalent movement disorder of the central nervous system, and affects more than 6.3 million people in the world. The characteristic motor features include tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and impaired postural stability. Current therapy based on augmentation or replacement of dopamine is designed to improve patients' motor performance but often leads to levodopa-induced adverse effects, such as dyskinesia and motor fluctuation. Clinicians must regularly monitor patients in order to identify these effects and other declines in motor function as soon as possible. Current clinical assessment for Parkinson's is subjective and mostly conducted by brief observations made during patient visits. Changes in patients' motor function between visits are hard to track and clinicians are not able to make the most informed decisions about the course of therapy without frequent visits. Frequent clinic visits increase the physical and economic burden on patients and their families. Objective: In this project, we sought to design, develop, and evaluate a prototype mobile cloud-based mHealth app, ``PD Dr'', which collects quantitative and objective information about PD and would enable home-based assessment and monitoring of major PD symptoms. Methods: We designed and developed a mobile app on the Android platform to collect PD-related motion data using the smartphone 3D accelerometer and to send the data to a cloud service for storage, data processing, and PD symptoms severity estimation. To evaluate this system, data from the system were collected from 40 patients with PD and compared with experts' rating on standardized rating scales. Results: The evaluation showed that PD Dr could effectively capture important motion features that differentiate PD severity and identify critical symptoms. For hand resting tremor detection, the sensitivity was .77 and accuracy was .82. For gait difficulty detection, the sensitivity was .89 and accuracy was .81. In PD severity estimation, the captured motion features also demonstrated strong correlation with PD severity stage, hand resting tremor severity, and gait difficulty. The system is simple to use, user friendly, and economically affordable. Conclusions: The key contribution of this study was building a mobile PD assessment and monitoring system to extend current PD assessment based in the clinic setting to the home-based environment. The results of this study proved feasibility and a promising future for utilizing mobile technology in PD management. },
